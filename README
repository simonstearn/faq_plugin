==========
This is a fork of ezfaq, a FAQ management plugin for Redmine by Zou Chaoqun. 


The aim of this fork is to bodge it together for use in the chiliproject branch of redmine.

NOTE: Migrations do not preserve history data from the old version of EZFaq.  I guess its possible to kludge 
this in SQL, but it wasnt important enough for us to develop.

Should be installed in ${CHILIPROJECT}/vendor/chiliproject_plugins/faq_plugin
